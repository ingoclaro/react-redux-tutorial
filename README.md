based on work from [redux async example](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/no-babel-hmre/examples/async)

The idea is to explore different features, to have it simpler to browse I created
different branches for each one:

no-redux: plain react example, no redux  
add-redux: add a redux store  
add-react-redux: using react-redux to connect the store with react  
simple-action: add a simple action
