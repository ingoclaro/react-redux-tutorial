based on work from [redux async example](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/no-babel-hmre/examples/async)

The idea is to explore different features, to have it simpler to browse I created
different branches for each one:

no-redux: plain react example, no redux  
[add-redux](https://github.com/ingoclaro/react-redux-tutorial/compare/no-redux...add-redux): add a redux store  
[add-react-redux](https://github.com/ingoclaro/react-redux-tutorial/compare/add-redux...add-react-redux): using react-redux to connect the store with react  
[simple-action](https://github.com/ingoclaro/react-redux-tutorial/compare/add-react-redux...simple-action): add a simple action
